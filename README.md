# Gold-Price-Prediction-Model-Using-Machin-Learning
In this project would forecast gold rates using the most comprehensive set of features and would apply various machine learning algorithms for forecasting and compare their results. We will create a machine learning linear regression model that takes information from the past Gold ETF (GLD) prices and returns a Gold price prediction the next day.
